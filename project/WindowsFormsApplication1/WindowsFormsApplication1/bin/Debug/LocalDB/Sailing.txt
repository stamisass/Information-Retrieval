Sailing down the length of the Great Lakes

Sailing from Toronto to Vancouver
There are three ways to sail a boat to Toronto from Vancouver.
The long way down the Pacific Coast to the Panama Canal and up the Atlantic side of North America.
The hard way through the Northwest Passage and hope you make it within the four weeks per year that it isn’t frozen.
The third and by far the easiest way is to have the boat shipped across the country, launch in Thunder Bay and sail the Great Lakes.
In June the third way is spectacular. Illusion V, a Mirage 33, was loaded on a flatbed tractor-trailer truck and, with my wife, we began the drive eastward from Vancouver.
We had planned to stay with the boat, but we stopped to visit friends in Kelowna, BC, and lost track of the boat on the first day.
Five days later we were stopped for gas about eighty kilometres from Thunder Bay, Ontario, when we saw the boat going down the highway! It was a good sign to begin my adventure by catching up with the boat after driving three thousand kilometres and five days across Canada.
