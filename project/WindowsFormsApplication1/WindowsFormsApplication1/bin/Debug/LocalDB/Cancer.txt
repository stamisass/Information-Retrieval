Elephants Rarely Get Cancer, Now We Know Why
8.10.2015 — By Janine Anderson
Could a cure for cancer be hiding in the elephant’s genetic code?
The massive mammals have a much lower incidence of cancer than one would expect, given their size and long life span.
It’s a phenomenon popularized by Oxford University epidemiologist Richard Peto, called Peto’s paradox, that larger animals have lower incidences of cancer, despite having exponentially more cells with the potential to mutate.
Now, researchers believe they know why, and it could reap dividends for humans.
